Problem 1:
Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).


To see if a number is divisible by 3 without using modulus operator.
First take a numner- n
Take two variables a and b
a- integer
b- real
We equate a and b assuming a= n/3 and b= n/3.
If both the values are same, then the number is divisible by 3.
As a is an integer and b is real, although they are same, then the number is perfectly divisible by 3.
