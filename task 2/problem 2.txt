Problem 2:
Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fihonacci number.(Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦).


In this program, we can know the nth term of fibonacci series.
Given F(0)=0, that is prev
F(1)=1, that is curr
F(2)= F(0)+F(1)= 0+1= 1, that is next
n is the position
let t=0,
while n>t
    if
      n=t+1, then we get the required position
        output next
    next= prev+curr
    prev= curr
    curr= next
So, the loop will be executed till we get the correct output
Here, I usedwhile loop.
